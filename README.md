# Code.Quiz

## Description

I created a coding quiz through javascript. The home page displays a highscore button on the top left, the timer on the top right, and a prompt in the middle to start the quiz. A user has 100 seconds to answer a series of questions. Each wrong answer will deduct 10 seconds from the total time. After the questions are answered, the user will be prompted a score at the end and a place to enter their initials to record their score. A high score page will be prompted and a user will be able to see their highest scores. They can then retake the quiz or clear the scores from the page.
